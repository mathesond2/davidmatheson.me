[Duty Status](http://www.dutystatus.com/) is a company that makes iOS and Android apps for small to mid-sized trucking companies. The trucking industry is highly regulated by the federal government in how much a driver can drive within a 24 hour period, in addition to how long they can be on the clock working, when they have to take breaks, and sleep as well. Duty Status gives drivers the capability to log their statuses, view their ongoing daily timetables in real-time ("I have x hours left until I have to take a break"), and change both their statuses or logbooks at moment's notice.

While the drivers' logbooks were taken care of by the native apps, there needed to be a web app where the drivers' data could be displayed and analyzed by their respective company, in addition to having the capability to edit driver info, add drivers to their roster, and chat with the drivers as well.

There were about 20 screens developed in the project overall, but **here are a few screens** to display the overall work:

###### Track My Fleet screen

###### Manage My Fleet screen

###### Track My Fleet screen

###### My Account screen
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/duty-status/my-account.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/duty-status/my-account.png"></a>

I wrote the html/sass for Duty Status' web app, taking existing designs and bringing them to the big(ger) screen, using Bootstrap Sass, Google Charts, and Jekyll (for the builds).

As of right now (Mar. 6, 2015), the web app is not out in the wild, but will be launched within the next couple months!
