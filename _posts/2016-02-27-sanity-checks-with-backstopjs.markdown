This is the first larger-scale talk I've done at IBM, under a program called FEDucation, which is a series of talks for Front-end Developers at IBM to stay up on the field and share knowledge across the company. It's every two weeks, and on this one I had about 80+ developers around the U.S. and Europe tune in for a nice chat on visual regression testing. Within this talk, I speak about the "hows" and "whys" of visual regression testing, briefly dip into the existential dilemma of choosing a front-end tool, then get back at it again with a BackstopJS demo and a brief spell on best practices. Enjoy. :)
