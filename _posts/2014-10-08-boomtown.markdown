As a UI Developer at BoomTown, I created functional interfaces for their flagship product, a CRM for mid-large size real estate companies and brokerage firms. In addition to increasing the scope of the CRM's functionality with new features, I also maintained and kept the existing front-end codebase clean. While most of the work is clearly unable to show because of non-disclosure agreements, I do have one piece that I'm incredibly proud of and see as a relevant display of my work and time at BoomTown, an internal directory app called BoomBook.


The issue was a similar one for all start-ups that experience a huge amount of growth within a small amount of time: how do we scale our company while still keeping the company culture that is such an integral part of our success? First things first, you have to know your co-workers.

"Who's that person who works down the hallway?"
"what was his name again?"

[Paul Drake](http://www.drakedesign.co/) (a fantastic dude) designed and I developed a single-page application that helped people match a name and title to a face, giving people the options to contact them via email or phone.

I'm most proud of it because it is a prime example of creating valuable technology that helps keep people connected to each other in a meaningful way, and it really helped maintain the culture that made the company so great in the first place.

Also, I'm proud of it because it was a technical feat for me, being the first large-scale app I had created with over 140+ regular users, using html templating (handlebarsjs), working with jQuery Mobile and Python in conjunction with MongoDB, which were previously completely uncharted waters.
