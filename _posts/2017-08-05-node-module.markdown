I wanted to learn how to create my own NPM Module, so I took a weekend out and decided to do it. I've always been fascinated by words that have no direct English translation, and I came across a pretty huge blog with over 500 words and definitions with no direct English translation. Using [webscraper.io](http://webscraper.io/), I created a quick web scraper to grab all the data, and then planned out the functionality I'd give to a user of this NPM Module, finally translating the functionality to code and making sure the appropriate tests were implemented and working.
