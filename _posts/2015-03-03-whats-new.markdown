#### + completely redesigned the UI and re-developed the front end of a flagship product.
([HomeTrackR](https://hometrackr.com/)'s Consumer Report)

#### + wrote the mark-up for an Angular Web App.
([Duty Status](http://www.dutystatus.com/))

#### + done most front end development for a new social platform for songwriters.
