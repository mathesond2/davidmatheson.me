 I've always written. There's just something incredibly satisfying about writing that's really akin to running. Maybe its the movement, the momentum of going forward, really doing something..chasing an idea down to the end of the line, literally. So yea, pretty excited about all of this. Of course, the question always comes up, "But what should I write about?" I suppose I'll start by answering questions on Quora, helping others from my own strange insights, then go from there. I strongly doubt I'll be writing a ton about tech trends or the like, though a few tutorials may pop up. Ya never know. More than likely, I'm interested in how and why people use things, making information not only available but accessible. 

>All this information and no understanding.

What else? Probably some book reports too. Currently, I've been reading Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius, and there's loads to talk about there. I read Zen Habits (zenhabits.net) on a fairly regular basis, so a lot of my thougts about writing, the need to write and so on, come from that...writing to help others, to alleviate suffering with no frills. But, as with everything else, there will likely be a ton of weird,funny stories that always end up following me. So yea, welcome to the blog.
