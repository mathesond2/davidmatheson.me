1. It's not enough to be a practitioner of best practices, you have to be a persistent evangelist of them as well.

2. Sometimes working in big companies means you have to play the game of "telephone" and you need to account for that in both your schedule and your mental bandwidth.

3. Agile with a little "a" is not a bad thing, and is often better for getting things done.

4. Grab the low-hanging fruit. No matter how simple or easy it may be, an accumulation of small wins can help a team build momentum.

5. Momentum is an incredibly priceless currency in a large company. Build it, maintain it, and safeguard it with a vengeance.

6. Appreciate the little wins because that often will keep you going.

7. Done is better than perfect. I knew this before, but further instances have confirmed this notion beyond a doubt.

8. If you don't find yourself growing in your project/team, carve out your own time for professional development and stick to it.

9. Mentorship is one of the most important aspects of your career, regardless of your career level. If you're not fortunate enough to have that on your team, actively seek it out within AND outside of your company.

10. Education should be self-initiated, but a good company will help facilitate your growth and learning. This is an extremely small, baseline requirement for investing in your employees.

11. Establishing a sense of urgency is often needed in order for people to make decisions.

12. Its important to be choosy on what you work on, and figuring out what exactly pushes the ball closer to the goal line.

13. It's important to be with others that practice your craft. Cowboys and lone wolves are a no-go.

14. Maintaining a daily log is an excellent way to stay on top of your game, understanding your own growth, and knowing where to go next professionally.

15. The drop-off from Design to Engineering is huge. Filling that gap produces tremendous results and tightens the iteration loop.

16. There's also a drop-off between user research and UI Design that needs to be accounted for, making sure your design work ties to the research done.

17. A solid front-end developer will also be a solid liaison between design and engineering efforts. You must be an advocate for Design in engineering scrums, and a cheerleader for Engineering in design critiques.

18. Public speaking should probably be mandatory for developers (#controversial), and there's nothing to it but to do it.

19. UI Developers always make 3 interfaces: the visual one for the user, the codebase for our current and future fellow developers, and our git workflow history as well. It is our job to continuously be stewards, advocates, and educators of all of them.

20. Carve out time for writing good documentation into your sprint cycle.

21. Accessibility is a requirement, not a nice to have, and should be considered from the first wireframe to deployment.
