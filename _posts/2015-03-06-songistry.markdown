[Songistry](http://songistry.com/) is a new social platform for songwriters to write, record, and pitch songs to other artists. Written in AngularJS, I've been developing the front end of the web application using Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, Angular-Bootstrap, Bootstrap Sass, and a couple angular plugins as well. This project doesnt live out in the wild yet, with a due date set in May 2015, so no screens till then.

#### Stay Tuned. :)
