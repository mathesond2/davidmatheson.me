![Image of Pomodoro Timer](../../../../images/pomodoro.png)

ReactJS has piqued my interest pretty hard lately, so I took [Wes Bos' Course](https://github.com/mathesond2/react-course) on ReactJS and then made this simple Pomodoro Technique app for better focus as I work on projects. There's plenty written about the Pomodoro Technique's effectiveness, but here's the gist:

1. Choose a task to be accomplished.
2. Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)
3. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper
4. Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)
5. Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break

Using this as a reference, I built my tiny React app, which you can check out .[here](https://mathesond2.github.io/pomodoro/).
