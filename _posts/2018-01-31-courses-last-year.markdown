To further augment my learning, I took a lot of courses in 2017. I usually open source my notes, which can help others' learning, and gives me an extra incentive to produce clean work that I can refer back to as well. Here they are:

1. [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/mathesond2/ds-and-algos)
2. [Testing Javascript Applications](https://github.com/mathesond2/testing-js-applications)
3. [API Design In NodeJS](https://github.com/mathesond2/api-design-node)
4. [Learn NodeJS](https://github.com/mathesond2/learn-node)
5. [Learn React](https://github.com/mathesond2/react-course)
