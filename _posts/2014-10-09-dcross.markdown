David Cross is easily one of the funnest people I've ever met. I met him a few years back when I was stil in the bakery business, and he easily became my favorite person. Previously a professional golf player, David began running and like everything else he does, he did it full on, becoming a professional ultra-runner (those crazy guys that run like 60 miles in a day) and triathlete, respectively. The site for his running business, Bearded Wonder, was in desperate need of a redesign, so I hooked him up with a slick one-pager, focusing on creating work that reflected positivity and upbeat-ness (is that a word?) shown in David's everyday interactions with customers and strangers alike.

Working this project was helpful because I often find myself jumping early into development. Since this project had a lighter timeline and less constraints, I spent much more of my time focusing on layout, design, and the usability. For example, I really wanted to use a JS plugin to make the two sections snap, but the amount of overhead to make that one effect happen would have been too much, performance-wise, and so I chose to leave it out.There are a few performance issues that I've had to factor in, because I typically dont use video, but of course, that always allows for more growth. Take a look!
