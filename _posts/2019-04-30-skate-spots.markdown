I've been skateboarding for like...23 years now (🤯🤯🤯), and I scraped a ton of skate spot data about a year ago with full intentions to do something with it. Of course, it then sat in a repo for over a year, and so I recently decided to put it to good use to flex on some newer tech.

I created [nycskatespots.com](https://nycskatespots.com/), a spot map of nearly 300 spots around the city. Skate spots can be filtered, searched, and are displayed in both list and map views.

This webapp was built using React, Typescript, Jest, react-material, and react-google-maps. In this project, I was especially interested in code coverage and tightened the app up considerably with both TypeScript and Jest. 

Take a look!!! 🏄‍🏄‍🏄‍♂️‍
