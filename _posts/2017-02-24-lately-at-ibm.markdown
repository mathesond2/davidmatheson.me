For almost two years, I've worked on a design team as a Front-end Developer at IBM Watson Health, working on a few different products within the Healthcare space aimed at giving physicians better tools for making treatment decisions and patient care in general. My role has been quite cross-functional, not only being responsible for the creation and maintenance of user interfaces, but being involved in the user research behind them: actively participating in user interviews, heuristic evaluations, and Design Thinking workshops to obtain a deeper understanding of the problem space we design and develop for.

#### The first product

I spent my first 9 months working on a to-be product aimed at giving physicians a better understanding of a patient's longitudinal record. When most people think of their doctor's record, they imagine a manila folder with their name on it, along with a series of doctors notes scribbled in with medical records, x-rays, medications, etc. With the advent of government mandates/incentives for digitizing these records, the patient chart is now overflowing with data. For example, a 3-day stint in intensive care could easily lead to 300 pages worth of information that has to be recorded for insurance purposes in a patient's record. Think of the average amount of doctor's visits and hospital stays over a lifetime, and this easily accounts to a landfill of data, where technically "everything" is there, but its hard to glean insights and understand patterns, especially if you're a physician with 5 minutes to spare.

My team was the first and only design team geared towards understanding the EMR problem space better, validating concepts, understanding technical limitations, and was also actively involved with Sales teams in drafting the product's purpose. We did Design with a capital "D" from the ground up, from workshops in drafting our team missions (called "Hills" at IBM), in addition to breaking those down to research and UX tasks, further design critiques, and iterations to finally arrive at a series of three high fidelity prototypes to be tested at a Children's Hospital.

#### A platform, not a product

The second product I worked on was aimed at taking both existing and future Watson Health capabilities and connecting them based on sensible user experiences rather than features. A solid amount of time was spent in research and in workshops with stakeholders in understanding the current problem space and context by which existing capabilities work in. As the sole Front-end Developer on my team, I spent 4 months creating an extensive prototype for user testing and further concept validation. After this project, I figured it would be necessary to break out the 32 individual components into their own 'components' repo, and with a bit of light refactoring, I did just that. This greatly assisted connecting the project's vision with the existing products' roadmap. As developers and product designers, we often wish to work from a clean slate, but that's nearly never the case, so componentizing the prototype work was a huge benefit in putting a real timeline to the work that had been done. The end product also acted as the first code contributions to the Watson Health Design Guide, so not too shabby.

#### And Lately?

Currently, I'm working on the Watson For Oncology product, which is aimed at helping physicians to give treatment recommendations based on machine learning models trained from academic institutions like Memorial-Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson. My team has been focused on improving the existing product, and using our prototype work as a base to jump start our work. Most recently I've created a prototype to assist physicians in a better form entry experience, abstracting away details necessary for Watson to gain a deeper insight into a patient's condition.
