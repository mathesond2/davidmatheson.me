In making things, I've noticed sometimes I need less of a reason to and more of an excuse to do so. And sometimes, it's a bit more FUN that way. Enter TXTSFROMMORRISSEY: An Ongoing Conversation Between Morrissey and The Dalai Lama. Created with [Kimono Labs](https://www.kimonolabs.com/), I used their web scraper services to grab two tweetbots automatic tweets and turn them into txt messages that continuously run on, sometimes to a hilarious banter between Morrissey, jaded and aloof, and The Dalai Lama, well-known for his wisdom and pure optimism. Take a look, get enlightened, it's definitely worth a few smirks. ;)
