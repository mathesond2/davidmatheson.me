In early 2013 I met Niccola Coppola (real name!) at a bakery. He had been recently handicapped by Multiple Sclerosis and had been able to get his disability benefits, notorious for their lengthy process, in record time. He decided to start up a business making sure disabled individuals get their Social Security benefits and in a timely fashion. Inspired by his pragmatic demeanor, I designed and developed a slick one-page site to begin his company and engage with his customer base.
